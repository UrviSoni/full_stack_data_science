    "#### 3. Describe three different data types.\n",
    "\n",
    "-> Standard data types that define the storage method on each of them in Python are as follows:-\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Numeric ( Integer, Complex Number, Float )\n",
    "2) Dictionary \n",
    "3) Boolean\n",
    "4) Set\n",
    "5) Sequence Type ( Stings, List, Tuple )\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 1) Numeric - Number stores numeric values. Python provides the type() function to know the data-type of the variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "-> Python supports three types of numeric data.\n",
    "\n",
    "1) int - Integer value can be any length such as integers 10, 2, 29, -20, -150 etc. Python has no restriction on the length of an integer. Its value belongs to int.\n",
    "\n",
    "a = 5\n",
    "type(a)\n",
    "\n",
    "<class 'int'>\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Float - Float is used to store floating-point numbers like 1.9, 9.902, 15.2, etc. It is accurate upto 15 decimal points.\n",
    "\n",
    "b = 2.3\n",
    "type(b)\n",
    "\n",
    "<class 'float'>\n",
    "\n",
    "3) complex - A complex number contains an ordered pair, i.e., x + iy where x and y denote the real and imaginary parts, respectively. The complex numbers like 2.14j, 2.0 + 2.3j, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "c = 1+3j\n",
    "type(c)\n",
    "\n",
    "<class 'complex'>\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 2) Sequence Type - It has three types : String, List and Tuple\n",
    "\n",
    "1) String - The string can be defined as the sequence of characters represented in the quotation marks. In Python, we can use single(' '), double(\" \"), or triple quotes(\"\"\" \"\"\" or ''' ''') to define a string.\n",

    "print(c)\n",
    "\n",
    "this is multiline\n",
    "string example\n",

    "2) List - The list are separated with a comma (,) and enclosed within square brackets []. We can modify the values in lists that's why lists are mutable.\n",

    "[1, \"Abc\", 2.3]\n",
    "\n",
    "3) Tuple - A tuple is similar to the list in many ways. Like lists, tuples also contain the collection of the items of different data types. The items of the tuple are separated with a comma (,) and enclosed in parentheses ().\n",
    "\n",
    "A tuple is a read-only data structure as we can't modify the size and value of the items of a tuple  that's why tuples are immutable.\n",

    "\n",
    "##### 3) Dictionary - Dictionary is an unordered set of a key-value pair of items. It is like an associative array or a hash table where each key stores a specific value. Key can hold any primitive data type, whereas value is an arbitrary Python object.\n",
    "\n",
    "-> The items in the dictionary are separated with the comma (,) and enclosed in the curly braces {}.\n",

    "dict_values(['Jimmy', 'Alex', 'john', 'mike'])\n",

    "##### 4) Boolean - Boolean type provides two built-in values, True (1) and False (0). It denotes by the class bool.\n",
    "\n",
    "print(type(True))  \n",
    "<class 'bool'>\n",

    "NameError: name 'false' is not defined\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 5) set - Set is the unordered collection of the data type. It is iterable, mutable(can modify after creation), and has unique elements. In set, the order of the elements is undefined; it may return the changed sequence of the element. The set is created by using a built-in function set(), or a sequence of elements is passed in the curly braces and separated by the comma. It can contain various types of values.\n",
